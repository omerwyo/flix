The series main characters consist of Kath Day-Knight, a cheerful 50-year-old woman, her self-indulgent daughter Kim Craig, Kath's boyfriend and second husband, the metrosexual Kel Knight, as well as Kim's estranged husband Brett Craig and her lonely, overweight \"second best friend\" Sharon Strzelecki. The series is set in the fictional suburb of Fountain Lakes in Melbourne. It is primarily filmed in Patterson Lakes.\n\nThe series was conceived by Turner and Riley in the early 1990s as a weekly segment of the Australian comedy series Fast Forward. The skit was then developed into a full-series. The first series of Kath & Kim premiered on ABC TV on 16 May 2002, with three further series following, while a television movie, entitled Da Kath and Kim Code, was broadcast nationally on 25 November 2005. Kath & Kim has garnered much critical acclaim since its debut, winning two Logie Awards, for \"Outstanding Comedy Programme\" and the \"Best Television Drama Series\" award at the Australian Film Institute Awards. In Australia, it has become a pop culture phenomenon, and is a success with audiences nationwide. Internationally, the series has spawned a cult fanbase, and in 2006 it was announced an American version of the series would be produced, to air on NBC. Riley and Turner served as executive producers on the US version. The American version was also picked up by Seven, which debuted the program on 12 October 2008, just three days after its debut in the United States.","release_year":2002,"age_certification":null,"runtime":24,"genres":"['comedy']","production_countries":"['AU']","seasons":4.0,"imdb_id":"tt0272397","imdb_score":8.3,"imdb_votes":4261.0,"tmdb_popularity":3.926,"tmdb_score":6.6},{"id":"tm186461","title":"No Direction Home: Bob Dylan","type":"MOVIE","description":"A chronicle of Bob Dylan's strange evolution between 1961 and 1966 from folk singer to protest singer to \"voice of a generation\" to rock star.","release_year":2005,"age_certification":"G","runtime":208,"genres":"['documentation', 'music']","production_countries":"['GB', 'US', 'JP']","seasons":null,"imdb_id":null,"imdb_score":null,"imdb_votes":null,"tmdb_popularity":7.58,"tmdb_score":7.7},{"id":"tm29555","title":"Friends with Money","type":"MOVIE","description":"After she quits her lucrative job, Olivia finds herself unsure about her future and her relationships with her successful and wealthy friends.","release_year":2006,"age_certification":"R","runtime":88,"genres":"['comedy', 'drama', 'romance']","production_countries":"['US']","seasons":null,"imdb_id":"tt0436331","imdb_score":5.8,"imdb_votes":30468.0,"tmdb_popularity":11.86,"tmdb_score":5.1},{"id":"tm103095","title":"Ip Man 2","type":"MOVIE","description":"Having defeated the best fighters of the Imperial Japanese army in occupied Shanghai, Ip Man and his family settle in post-war Hong Kong.

At her youngest sister's wedding, their overbearing mother thrusts her into an orchestrated matchmaking with the ultimate Edo man: Osaze. He's handsome, successful, and from a good family, which makes him perfect Nigerian-husband material. But in an unexpected turn of events, Isoken meets Kevin and falls in love with him, and he just might be what she truly wants in a partner. The only problem: not only is he not an Edo man--he is Oyinbo (Caucasian). Isoken is a romantic dramedy that explores cultural expectation, racial stereotypes, and the bonds that unite families in touching, dramatic, and comedic ways.","release_year":2017,"age_certification":null,"runtime":100,"genres":"['romance', 'comedy', 'drama']","production_countries":"['NG']","seasons":null,"imdb_id":"tt6685776","imdb_score":6.4,"imdb_votes":322.0,"tmdb_popularity":2.263,"tmdb_score":4.7},{"id":"tm851055","title":"God Calling","type":"MOVIE","description":"When Sade, the central character suffers a personal tragedy, she is taken on a journey of self-discovery and faith which transforms the lives all those around her.

The film reveals the extraordinary life of the charismatic Abdus Salam, in all its color, vitality and tragedy. It is the story of a man who traversed two worlds with ease: one of science and religion, modernity and tradition, war and peace and obscurity and celebrity. When he won the Nobel prize in 1979, he became the very first Pakistani to achieve this distinction, and only the fourth from the subcontinent. Born in 1926 in a remote village in Punjab, British India, Salam was a child prodigy. He came from humble beginnings, growing up in a small brick house with a large family of eleven. While Salam's legacy looms large in the world of physics, he is largely forgotten in Pakistan because of his faith. Children do not read about him and he is still vilified and maligned by right wing clerics for being a \"Qadiani\"-a derogatory term for someone belonging to the Ahmadiyya community. By telling this complex story of a man who due to extremism could not strengthen his people as he so deeply desired, the film draws attention to the state of affairs in the world today, where knowledge is sacrificed at the altar of ignorance and intolerance, depriving the coming generation of all that is precious.","release_year":2018,"age_certification":null,"runtime":75,"genres":"['documentation']","production_countries":"['US']","seasons":null,"imdb_id":"tt7904606","imdb_score":7.8,"imdb_votes":418.0,"tmdb_popularity":1.672,"tmdb_score":7.3},{"id":"ts80859","title":"Here to Heart","type":"SHOW","description":"She has more than work on her mind.
